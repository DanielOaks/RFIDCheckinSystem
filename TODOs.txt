TODO Checkin System:

1) change login.php: users should be using their username/pw to login, not swipe-id/pw.

2) error handling at signup.php: what happens if…
 - user selects a username that already exists?
 - Edge staff enters an RFID card number that was already assigned to another Edge visitor?
- signup.php: add "repeat password field", only accept signup if both passwords match

3) update-profile.php:
- right now swipe-id cannot be changed (text field not editable), but what happens if user looses his RFID card. => my suggestion for the 1st rollout: write us an email and we change it in the DB.. later we might think about an administration userinterface for such purposes…

4) create Processing/JAVA script for VSO's to read an RFID card number and assign it to a user, i.e.
- VSO opens Processing/Java Program.
- touches a new (unassigned) RFID card to the ID20 reader (connected to the PC's USB port)
- Processing/Java Program spits out the RFID card number
- VSO copy pastes this number into signup.php
- user fills out username/password
- VSO labels RFID-card and hands over to user

5) create word-template for RFID-card label
- username
- URL to login.php
- QR-code to login.php (if we provide a JQuery mobile version of the profile website?)
- feedback / questions at checkin@edge.org.au

6) JQuery mobile website version of the profile website
