TODO Checkin System:

---HIGH PRIORITY---

1) change login.php: users should be using their username/pw to login, not swipe-id/pw.

2) error handling at signup.php: what happens if…
 - user selects a username that already exists?
 - Edge staff enters an RFID card number that was already assigned to another Edge visitor?
- signup.php: add "repeat password field", only accept signup if both passwords match

3) include two checkboxes (mutually exclusive, i.e. you can select one OR the other OR none of them (default is none)):
- I am happy to be approached by other users
- Don't talk to me, I busy doing my own stuff

the checkboxes connect to the "dontdisturb" field in the "edge_users" table (as of meetmee_checkin6.sql):
happy to talk to others = 0
don't talk to me = 1
no box checked (default) = NULL (default value in the DB, so nothing needs to be passed)

4) for each skill/expertise text field: create a drop down list that enables the user to select his expertise level (1 beginner - 5 expert) for each skill,
and connect to DB field: expertise_table->level

---MEDIUM PRIORITY---

5) create word-template for RFID-card label
- username
- URL to login.php
- QR-code to login.php (if we provide a JQuery mobile version of the profile website?)
- feedback / questions at checkin@edge.org.au

6) JQuery mobile website version of the profile website?

7) 3D print a case for the RFID reader


---LOW PRIORITY---

8) create an MySQL Views / API for developers to read from the checkin-DB 

9) update-profile.php:
- right now swipe-id cannot be changed (text field not editable), but what happens if user looses his RFID card. => my suggestion for the 1st rollout: write us an email and we change it in the DB.. later we might think about an administration userinterface for such purposes…


---LOG---
DONE / - Mark 20 March, 2012 [4) create Processing/JAVA script for VSO's to read an RFID card number and assign it to a user, i.e.
- VSO opens Processing/Java Program.
- touches a new (unassigned) RFID card to the ID20 reader (connected to the PC's USB port)
- Processing/Java Program spits out the RFID card number
- VSO copy pastes this number into signup.php
- user fills out username/password
- VSO labels RFID-card and hands over to user]
