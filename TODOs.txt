TODO Checkin System:

---HIGH PRIORITY---

Done >> 1) change login.php: users should be using their username/pw to
login, not swipe-id/pw.

2) error handling at signup.php: what happens if?
Done >> - user selects a username that already exists?
 Need to create Form >> - Edge staff enters an RFID card number that was
already assigned to another Edge visitor?
Done >> - signup.php: add "repeat password field", only accept signup if
both passwords match

3) include two checkboxes (mutually exclusive, i.e. you can select one
OR the other OR none of them (default is none)):
Need to do >> - I am happy to be approached by other users
Don't Disturb implemented >> - Don't talk to me, I busy doing my own stuff

the checkboxes connect to the "dontdisturb" field in the "edge_users" table (as of meetmee_checkin6.sql):
happy to talk to others = 0
don't talk to me = 1
no box checked (default) = NULL (default value in the DB, so nothing needs to be passed)

Done >> 4) for each skill/expertise text field: create a drop down list
that enables the user to select his expertise level (1 beginner - 5
expert) for each skill,
and connect to DB field: expertise_table->level

Need to do >> 5) add "terms and conditions" check-box at signup.php
page. box must be ticked in order to signup. "terms and conditions"
label is a link
that opens a new browser window... I am working with the Edge on the
content, e.g. users must admit that their content will be visible
on public screens, projections, etc...

Need to do >> 6) add DB fields and checkboxes in profile page for
"background". background can be "technology", "art", "music", "DIY",

Need to do >> 7) add Feedback form to profile page. "Let us know what
you think about this system! Send us your Feedback" => Link to
pop up html page. writes feedback to DB field feedback!


Mark B:
- change slq views according to mark's new DB structure...
- Need to do >> 8) add google analytics to profile website


Usability web interface:

- what if a user forgot his password? => email password to his email address
- Projects => name: Meetings, Collaborations, Projects
	- should be listed within the user_edge website, similar to interests and expertise, rather than separate file... save a click! 
- edge_user: why multiple update buttons? one update/cancel button should be at the very bottom.



---MEDIUM PRIORITY---

6) JQuery mobile website version of the profile website?



---LOW PRIORITY---

9) update-profile.php:
- right now swipe-id cannot be changed (text field not editable), but what happens if user looses his RFID card. => my suggestion for the 1st rollout: write us an email and we change it in the DB.. later we might think about an administration userinterface for such purposesâ€¦


---LOG---
DONE / - Mark 20 March, 2012 [4) create Processing/JAVA script for VSO's to read an RFID card number and assign it to a user, i.e.
- VSO opens Processing/Java Program.
- touches a new (unassigned) RFID card to the ID20 reader (connected to the PC's USB port)
- Processing/Java Program spits out the RFID card number
- VSO copy pastes this number into signup.php
- user fills out username/password
- VSO labels RFID-card and hands over to user]



IDEAS:
- create pie-visualisation: what background (fixed categories) do people have who are in right now? => click on a graph sector and see what is behind.
- what skills do the regulars at the Edge have (people who have checked in more than once per week on average)
- after checkin: print out little sheet of who's doing what and where at The Edge.
