This Project is specifically being created for the "The Edge" Digital Culture Centre.

The aim of the project is to have people who access The Edge, having be issued an RFID tag,
use it when entering The Edge and login to a Mulitouch Table and view details on fellow Edgers as well as there own profile. 



NOTES:
1) Applying the checkin-system project to another country / timezone

The DATETIME timestamps in the MySQL table 'checkin' are stored in UTC +10 (Brisbane local time) format.
In case this project is to be applied to a different location with a particular local time, following adjustments need to be made:

- checkin_submit_manual.php => change $dateTime variable accordingly
- MySQL database: 'view_checkins' VIEW needs to be deleted and created again with a statement that sets the timezone accordingly, e.g. [SET time_zone = '+10:00']; this is 
necessary because the 'view_checkins' VIEW has a MySQL function that compares the checkin time with the local NOW() time of the MySQL server.

With the changes mentioned above, the checkin system can be run from any PHP/MySQL server, independent from its location (i.e. timezone). UNIX_timestamps are not appropriate
for this project as it envisions to make use of MySQL DATESTAMP functions in the future.
